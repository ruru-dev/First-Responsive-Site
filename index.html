              Link is the main character and protagonist of the The Legend of Zelda series. He has appeared
              across many incarnations throughout the series, usually depicted as an ordinary boy or young 
              man who becomes a legendary hero by saving the world through feats of courage.[110] He is often
              the holder of the Triforce of Courage, a sign of his being chosen by the Golden Goddesses. He 
              is typically seen wielding a sword and shield, most often the Master Sword and Hylian Shield.
